# Hedera Community Calls Repository

This repository is used to keep track of the community calls for [Hedera](https://docs.hedera.com/).

## Overview

### Purpose

There are two types of calls - technical and non-technical,
and each has their own format.
This repository aims to catalogue all of them.

Calls will be live streamed on multiple platforms,
and a recording of them will be shared the
[Hedera YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/hederahashgraph).
